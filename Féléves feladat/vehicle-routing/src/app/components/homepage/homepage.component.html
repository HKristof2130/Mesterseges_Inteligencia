    <h3> The problem itself</h3> <br>
    <p>I'm trying to solve the problem with weighting. How want I do that? "Easily", I will give a weight to each node and with this way I the vehicles will take the least amount of time
        to reach destinations. Hovewer there will be a "rookie" vehicle who will clean up the mass if it is nesesarry.
