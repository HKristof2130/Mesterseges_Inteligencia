    <h3> Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)</h3>
    <p>I'am trying to solve the problem with weighting. How want I do that? "Easily" I will give a weight to each node and with this way I the vehicles will take the least amount of time
        to reach destinations. Hovewer there will be a "rookie" vehicle who will clean up the mass if it is nesesarry.
